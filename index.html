		<h4>A sheriff’s vehicle originally bought at an auction in Tennessee</h4>
		<p>The car was a boxy late model Ford sedan, white over black, innocuous bordering on invisible, and very fast. It had been a sheriff’s vehicle originally bought at an auction in Tennessee, and further modified for speed. Perry and I listened to the big engine idle, checked the dual scoops on the hood. I had not seen one of those on the road since high school. <i>“You like the car?”</i> Perry asked. <i>“It’s all right,”</i> I said, my eyes ahead. <i>“I’ve never been much of a Ford man.”</i> Perry shifted in his bucket, <i>“You know something about cars? For city cruising, it'll do.”</i> I spent my childhood in Riverdale, New Jersey, thirty miles north from long, narrow Manhattan Island, which sits in the bay, among other islands,</p>
